Objective:
To monitor real-time system resources (CPU, memory, disk, and network usage) using Netdata installed through Docker.
Steps Performed:
1. Installed Docker:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
2. Started and Enabled Docker Service:

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
3. Added User to Docker Group (to avoid permission issues):

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
4. Verified Docker Installation:

docker ps
docker --version
5. Pulled the Netdata Image:

docker pull netdata/netdata
6. Ran the Netdata Container:

docker run -d --name=netdata -p 19999:19999 netdata/netdata
7. Opened Port 19999 in AWS EC2 Security Group:
- Type: Custom TCP
- Port: 19999
- Source: 0.0.0.0/0
8. Accessed Dashboard:

http://<public-ip>:19999

Observed real-time monitoring of:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network performance
9. Captured Screenshot of the running Netdata dashboard.
Observation:
Netdata provides a web-based dashboard that continuously monitors system health, processes, and performance in real time with minimal setup.
Conclusion:
Successfully installed and configured Netdata using Docker to visualize and monitor system resource usage in real time.
